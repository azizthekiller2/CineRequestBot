# 🎬 CineRequestBot

**A Pyrogram-based Telegram bot that delivers movie & series search results via a private results channel — Aziz style.**

Users search in the group → results go to a **private channel** → group only gets a button link.  
No movie links ever appear in the group. ✅ Copyright-safe architecture.

## 🛡️ Checkpoint & Single-Command Revert System

Before applying any code modifications or bug fixes, create a checkpoint:

```bash
# Save a snapshot to .bak/
./checkpoint.sh save "before_bug_fix"
```

If anything goes wrong or the bot begins crashing, instantly revert with a single command:

```bash
# Revert to latest snapshot (and auto-restarts systemd bot service)
./restore.sh
```

### Other Helpful Commands:
```bash
./checkpoint.sh list          # View all saved checkpoints
./checkpoint.sh diff          # View code changes since latest checkpoint
./checkpoint.sh restore <id>  # Revert to a specific past checkpoint
```
